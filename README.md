APRIL PRACTICE TASK REVIEW
TEAM_03
Mentor: Rajeswari
Lead: Ajay Sigireddy

The Task aims to setting up the data page. The data page is basically where users can upload their data and look through the datasets we have and also the data which was uploaded should be added to the collections of datasets. When someone clicks on a dataset, they should be able to see the data in an easy-to-understand way, like in tables.
